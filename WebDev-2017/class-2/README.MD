## Instructions
In this exercise, we will be working on updating an HTML file to include some of the tags that we have talked about today. The page includes some styles already so it will be a little more exciting than a plain page.

1. Open ```index.html``` in your browser.
2. Open ```index.html``` using Visual Studio code to start making edits to the file as described in the following instructions. (The instructions are diplicated in the file.) After making each change, reload the page in the browser to see the modifications to the page.
3. Include the source of the image (```camshots.jpg```) in the image tagbelow. Also provide alternate text so that the image will be described to users who are rely on a Web reader.
4. Although we have a clickable image we should still add a navigation panel as well. Add a navigation division with an unordered list that contains list items with hyperlinks to these 3 Web pages:
					Home Page: ```index.html``` 
					Tips: ```tips.html``` and
					Glossary: ```glossary.html```
Include a tooltip for each of these links.
5. Copy the header and nav divisions into the other two files (```tips.html``` and ```glossary.html``` ) so that the header and navigation panels are identical on all 3 pages.
6. Convert the text ```Photo of the Month``` within the aside to be a level-one heading.
7. Include an image tag which displays the ```rainbow.png``` picture in the page within the ```<figure>``` tag. Be sure to include alternate text which will be read to users who are rely on a Web reader.
8. Convert the group of paragraphs within the aside to be an unordered list.
9. Open the glossary.html file. After replacing the header and nav division in the ```glossary.html``` file, add an id attribute for the header element. Call this element "top" so that it can be identified by an internal hyperlink later in this file.
10. Modify the paragraph near the bottom of the section which contains the text ```Return to Top...``` so that it is a hyperlink that ```jumps``` to the top of this page instead.
11. Feel free to take a short break if you finish before the quiz.
