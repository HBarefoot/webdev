## Instructions###
In this exercise, we're going to arrange our files into the proper folders to keep this project organized. There are several types of files and we generally want to keep them grouped together. The file structure that we will create follows the model structure that is used by Bootstrap. Since we will be using Bootstrap a bit later in the course, it's a good idea to start organizing our files that way.

#Warning#
This instructions will not work if you are using the compressed version of the folder. Be sure that you have uncompressed the folder and that you are accessing the uncompressed version of the folder.

1. Open ```index.html``` in your browser.
2. Notice that there are several resources that could not be found and the page likely doesn't look very good because these resource files are not organized.
3. Open ```index.html``` in your editor.
4. Notice the 3 CSS files which are linked to the Web page using the ```<link>``` tags on lines 7, 9, & 10.
7. Create a new folder called ```css``` in the folder which contains the ```index.html``` file and move the three CSS files in this new folder.
8. Notice the 2 image files which are linked to the Web page using the ```<img>``` tags on lines 109 & 127.
9. Create a folder called ```img``` in the folder which contains the index.html file and place the two image files in this new folder.
10. Open the ```landing-page.css``` file in your editor (remember this file should be located in the ```css``` folder you created a few moments ago).
11. Notice on line 38 in this file, that there is a background image file that should be located in the ```img``` folder as well.
12. Create a new subfolder inside of the ```img``` folder called ```backgrounds```. 
13. Copy the image called ```intro-bg.jpg``` and place it in the new ```backgrounds``` folder.
14. Reopen ```index.html``` in your editor.
15. Notice the 3 JavaScript files which are linked to the Web page using the ```<script>``` tags on lines 157, 159, & 161.
16. Create a folder called ```js``` in the folder which contains the ```index.html``` file and place the three JavaScript files in this new folder.
15. Refresh (or reopen) the page in the browser.
